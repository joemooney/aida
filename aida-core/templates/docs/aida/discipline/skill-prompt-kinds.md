# Skill prompt kinds — classifying `AskUserQuestion` prompts

> Author guidance for AIDA skill templates. trace:STORY-287

When a skill template asks the user something, that prompt belongs to one
of two **kinds**. The kind decides whether the prompt pauses or
auto-resolves under the `--zen` autonomy mode. Classifying prompts well is
what makes `aida queue work --zen` ("advisor on standby") useful: the
mechanical clicks disappear, the real questions still reach the human.

## The two kinds

### `kind:confirmation`

A mechanical yes/no whose **default action is obvious**. The user almost
always says yes; the prompt exists as a courtesy pause, not because there
is a real decision. Examples:

- "Open this PR?"
- "All green — merge?"
- "Grab the next queued item?"
- "Mark the review story rejected?" (after the rejection is already decided)

Under `--zen`, a `kind:confirmation` prompt **auto-resolves to option 1**
(its first / recommended choice) without rendering interactive UI.

### `kind:design-fork`

A genuine choice between **meaningful alternatives**, where guessing wrong
has real cost. Reserved for choices the skill genuinely cannot make alone:
the spec is ambiguous, callers diverge, or the blast radius of a wrong
guess is large. Examples:

- "Scope this to `aida show` only, or unify status display across every
  CLI surface?"
- "The PR has commits with no `(REQ-ID)` trailer — how should the diff be
  attributed?"
- "Acceptance criteria are vague — tighten the spec, or accept the gap?"

Under `--zen`, a `kind:design-fork` prompt **always surfaces**. The advisor
is at the keyboard precisely to answer these.

### `kind:bug-spotted` (reserved)

A third kind — "the implementer found something mid-work; file it as a
BUG?" — is reserved for the `--no-human` punt slice (it routes through the
implementer-findings surface, STORY-285). It is not yet operative; until
that slice lands, classify a found-bug prompt as `design-fork` (pause-safe).

## How to classify

**Most prompts are `confirmation`.** `design-fork` should be *sparse and
meaningful* — if every prompt is a design-fork, `--zen` resolves nothing
and the mode is pointless. When in doubt, ask: *would the user ever
realistically answer anything but yes?* If no, it is a confirmation.

But err on the side of `design-fork` for the genuinely uncertain case:
auto-resolving a real question is worse than over-asking. That is also why
**an un-annotated prompt defaults to `design-fork`** — a missing annotation
fails safe (pauses) rather than wrongly auto-resolving.

## The option-1 convention

Auto-resolve picks **option 1** — so the *first* option a prompt lists must
be the **smallest-valuable-slice / lowest-risk default**. Subsequent
options expand scope or accept more risk. For a guard prompt ("ship a
half-done batch anyway?"), option 1 is the *safe refusal*, not the bypass.

This is the same discipline as `feedback_pushback_on_overengineering.md`:
ship the smallest correct thing, defer the rest as a follow-up.

## The annotation

Tag each prompt with an HTML comment **directly above** the prompt prose:

```markdown
<!-- kind:confirmation -->
Show the title and Summary. Ask explicitly: "Open this PR?"
```

HTML comments survive markdown rendering and are greppable for a future
lint (warn when an `AskUserQuestion`-style prompt carries no `kind:`).

## How the three autonomy modes consume the kind

| Mode | Persona | `kind:confirmation` | `kind:design-fork` |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Default** (no flag) | "Driving" — approves each step | Pause + ask | Pause + ask |
| **`--zen`** (`AIDA_ZEN=1`) | "Advisor on standby" | **Auto-resolve to option 1** | Pause + ask |
| **`--no-human`** (`AIDA_HEADLESS=1`) | "Absent" | Auto-resolve | *Punt* (future slice) |

`--no-human` > `--zen` > default. The headless drain is the stronger mode;
when both are set, `--no-human` wins. The `--no-human` punt of a design-fork
(pick a defensible default, file the deferred decision as a finding) is a
follow-up slice — it depends on the headless implementer (STORY-276) and the
findings-persistence surface (STORY-285). Until then `--zen` is the
operative mode and design-forks always pause.

## Where this is wired

- `aida queue work --zen` (and `AIDA_ZEN=1`) — `aida-cli`, sets the env var
  the launched session inherits.
- The four core skills carry kind annotations + an "Autonomy mode" section:
  `/aida-pickup`, `/aida-implement`, `/aida-pr`, `/aida-review`. Other
  skills are a follow-up.
- `docs/autonomous-drain.md` — the three-mode table + when to use each.

## Operator-explicit invocation — `disable-model-invocation` (TASK-575)

The autonomy `kind:` annotation above governs **what happens once a skill
runs** — does this prompt pause or auto-resolve. A second, stricter axis
governs **whether the skill runs at all without an operator typing
`/<skill-name>`**: the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter key.

```yaml
---
name: aida-pickup
description: …
disable-model-invocation: true
allowed-tools:
  - Bash
---
```

When the frontmatter sets `disable-model-invocation: true`, Claude Code
will **never auto-invoke** the skill from a description match — the
skill runs only when the operator types `/aida-pickup` (or whatever the
slash command is). Set this on any skill whose side effects make
auto-invocation unsafe.

### Categories that warrant it

Borrowed from *Beyond the Prompt: Claude Code* — defensive UX for skills
with destructive or hard-to-reverse shapes:

| Category | What can go wrong | Skills in this category |
|---|---|---|
| **ship** | Commits land, PRs open, releases tag — public state mutation Claude shouldn't trigger on a stray "let's ship this" | `/aida-commit`, `/aida-pr`, `/aida-release`, `/aida-review` |
| **drain** | Multi-spec autonomous workloads kick off — Claude shouldn't trigger an unattended run from "what should I work on?" | `/aida-drain-queue`, `/aida-pickup`, `/aida-implement` |
| **force-push / rewrite** | Branch history mutates non-reversibly | `/aida-rebase` |
| **delete / heal** | Stale leases, orphan briefs, sessions are removed — operator-initiated state may look "stale" to an over-eager auto-trigger | `/aida-doctor`, `/aida-sync` |
| **state-mutation** | Spec lifecycle parks (NeedsAttention), substrate writes (memory, CLAUDE.md), advisor binding decisions | `/aida-punt`, `/aida-learn`, `/aida-advise` |

### Categories that should stay auto-invocable

The point of skill auto-invocation is the *proactive* surface — captures
and reviews Claude is supposed to fire from context, not wait to be
asked. Don't set the flag on:

- **Read-only** skills (`/aida-search`, `/aida-status`, `/aida-queue`,
  `/aida-show`, `/aida-standup`, `/aida-digest`, `/aida-onboard`)
- **Proactive-capture** skills designed to fire from conversation
  (`/aida-req`, `/aida-capture`, `/aida-doc`)
- **Quality / analysis** skills with no destructive side effect
  (`/aida-evaluate`, `/aida-grill`, `/aida-architecture`,
  `/aida-compiler-warnings`, `/aida-code-review`, `/aida-docs-review`)

### How to decide for a new skill

Ask: *"if Claude misinterprets a stray sentence in conversation and
fires this skill, what is the worst it can do in 30 seconds?"*

- **Modify the working tree, branch, queue, spec lifecycle, or
  substrate files** → set `disable-model-invocation: true`. The cost of
  forcing the operator to type `/<skill>` is small; the cost of an
  unwanted auto-invocation can be a lost branch, a parked spec, a
  re-shuffled queue, or a memory file the operator didn't approve.
- **Print things, query state, suggest filings without writing** → leave
  it off. The proactive surface is the whole point.

The frontmatter is independent of `kind:` annotations — a
`disable-model-invocation: true` skill still classifies its
`AskUserQuestion` prompts as `confirmation` or `design-fork` for `--zen`
mode once the operator has explicitly invoked it.

## The orchestrator exit signal (TASK-329)

A `kind:confirmation` prompt under `--zen` auto-resolves to option 1 — but
when that option is *"exit the session"*, the skill hits a wall. The
`aida queue work --auto-complete` orchestrator launches each Claude phase as
a subprocess and waits for it to exit. In interactive mode the user presses
Ctrl+D; a skill **cannot synthesize that EOF** from inside its own session
(BUG-230). Auto-resolving the prompt prints the annotation but the REPL
stays open at `❯`, and the orchestrator blocks forever.

The fix is a one-way file signal between the skill and the orchestrator:

1. The orchestrator picks a sentinel path under `.aida/sessions/`
   (`<session-id>.exit-requested`, a sibling of the `<session-id>.toml`
   lease file) and exports its absolute path to the child as the
   **`AIDA_EXIT_SENTINEL`** environment variable.
2. Instead of a blocking wait, the orchestrator spawns the child and polls
   (~100ms) for two things: did the child exit on its own, and did the
   sentinel appear.
3. The skill, as its **absolute last action**, runs:

   ```bash
   [ -n "${AIDA_EXIT_SENTINEL:-}" ] && touch "$AIDA_EXIT_SENTINEL"
   ```

4. The orchestrator sees the sentinel, terminates the child's process tree
   (SIGTERM, a 2s grace window, then SIGKILL) and continues the pipeline.

### The rule for skill authors

**The sentinel touch is the absolute last action of the session.** It must
come *after* every commit, PR open, push, comment, and verdict-file write —
anything the skill does after touching the sentinel is racing the reap and
may be killed mid-flight. Touch it exactly **once**, and only the skill that
performs the session's genuinely last action touches it: when one skill
hands off to another (`/aida-pickup` → `/aida-pr`), the hand-off target owns
the exit, not the caller.

Only touch the sentinel when **all** of these hold: `$AIDA_EXIT_SENTINEL` is
set (the orchestrator is polling for it), the end-of-session prompt is a
`kind:confirmation` that `--zen` or a headless drain auto-resolved to
"exit", and there is no further hand-off. In default interactive mode, leave
the sentinel untouched — the user presses Ctrl+D.

The annotation the skill prints when it auto-resolves the exit names the
mechanism, so the scrollback shows what happened:

```
↳ zen: auto-resolved "next step" → ⇒ Exit — orchestrator will reap in ~100ms
```

The protocol is a deliberately minimal primitive (one env var, one empty
file). It is built for the EXIT case; STORY-287's deferred `--no-human`
design-fork *punt* can extend it later with a second sentinel
(`.punt-requested`) carrying a structured body — but that is built only when
the punt slice picks it up, not on speculation. The polling/grace window is
tunable via `AIDA_EXIT_POLL_MS` / `AIDA_EXIT_GRACE_MS`. Implementation:
`aida-cli/src/exit_signal.rs`.
