/// missing a pickup-or-review half, and surfaces the rest ranked by
/// `|delta_steps|` descending. Tied gaps break by recency. The mismatch
/// view IS the calibration view this STORY adds; the broader autonomy
/// report (TASK-340) gains `--by` / `--calibration` slices in a

/// Add a promoted finding to a role's work queue.
///
/// Findings are follow-ups that usually need an implementer, so the default
/// route is the `implementer` queue; `for_override` (the `--for` flag) picks
/// a different role. Returns the role it routed to so the caller can name it
/// in the success message.
///
/// Kept separate from the status flip in `FindingsCommand::Promote` so a
/// queue-add failure surfaces as a non-zero exit *before* the finding is
/// marked Approved — BUG-231 was a silent "Approved but in no queue"
/// half-state because the old promote path flipped status and printed
/// "joins the work queue" without ever calling `queue add`.
/// trace:BUG-231 | ai:claude

/// BUG-1651: production promotes go through [`queue_promoted_finding_entry`];
/// this role-returning form remains for the BUG-231 tests.
